7. Change a path to log file in src.main.resources.log4j.properties.

9. For testing this API you can download Postman or another such an analogue.

10. For authorization, you must add a new header, where Authorization is key and Basic email:password is value, where email:password must be encoded to Base64 format.

There are test data that you can use.
Thereâ€™s one user already registered with ADMIN role (email = "admin@gmail.com", password = "1234
") and
one user with USER role (email = "user@gmail.com", password = "1234"). You can change these test data in InjectDataController if you want.
